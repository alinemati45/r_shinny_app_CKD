#### Project limitation:


**1. Missing value.**

Missing data (or missing values) is defined as the data value that is not stored for a variable in the observation of interest.

- Deal with missing values by KNN

A frequently used technique for imputation of missing data is to employ a model to forecast the missing values. 

This necessitates the creation of a model for each input variable with missing values. 

While any of a variety of alternative models may be used to forecast missing values, the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) technique has been shown to be highly effective, and is sometimes referred to as "nearest neighbor imputation."

**2. Having Small Data**

A small sample size also affects the reliability of the result because it leads to a higher variability, which may lead to bias.
