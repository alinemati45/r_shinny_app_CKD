#### The independent variables:

The class of Chronic kidney disease/ not Chronic kidney diseaseare visualized as a binary outcome using a series of basic bar plots. On the left, you can see those who have and do not have ckd.


However, If we want to explore the effect of several independent variables simultaneously, we can use a Sankey plot. 
A Sankey plot shows you how these variable work together. You can literally see how many people of each of group Chronic kidnery diseaes (1)
 or Not Chronic kidnery diseaes (0).

How would you respond? Which one has the most effect on chronic kidney disease?

Age and class appear to have a significant effect on CKD.

Rather than guessing, we may use logistic regression to simultaneously assess the influence of age and class.
You have never used linear regression?
