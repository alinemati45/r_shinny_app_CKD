This app illustrates some fundamental concepts in logistic regression. We use Pus Cell, Age, and Blood Pressure to estimate the effect on the Chronic Kidney disease database.

## Variables:

1- Age

2- Blood Pressure:

- Blood Pressure: Low  : 80 or less

- Blood Pressure: Mid  : 80- 120

- Blood Pressure: High : 120 or Above

3- Pus Cell: It consists of a buildup of dead, white blood cells that form when the body's immune system responds to the infection


4- Class: CKD =1, NotCKD=0

High blood pressure is both a cause and result of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and affects the great majority of people with the disease. 

Controlling hypertension is critical in patients with CKD because it results in a slower course of the disease and a decreased risk of Cardiovascular disease. 

How many people have CKD? 

Who has a higher chance to get Chronic Kidney disease? what about Pus Cell & Age? On the left side, you can see a simple bar chart to get a first impression.
