Controlling hypertension is critical in patients with CKD because it results in a slower course of the disease and a decreased risk of CVD.


How many people have Chrinic Kidney diease? Who have a higher change to get Chrinic Kidney diease? what about Pus Cell & Age?
On the left side you can see simple bar chart to get a first impression. Who survived the Titanic? 


Additionally, you can download the content or view the Shiny App's source code.
