#### How well does the model perform?

You are probably aware that R2 is frequently used to evaluate the performance of a linear model. 
Regrettably, evaluating the performance of a logistic regression is more difficult. 
There are faux R2 values for logistic regression that can be used to compare nested models, but they cannot be interpreted as explained variance in the same way that they are for linear regression. 
Rather than that, you might come across two terms: sensitivity and specificity.

Sensitivity considers if our classification of the true outcome was correct. How many persons were classified as having chronic kidney disease (true positives) by our model? The mosaic plot illustrates how many persons developed (or did not develop) CKD; the x-axis represents our observations, while the y-axis represents our prediction. The sensitivity can be calculated by dividing the true positives by the total number of patients with CKD. As a result, the sensitivity equals 0.7142857. 


How many people did we classify as not-CKD, who actually did not Chronic kidney disease the class (true negative)? Thus, specificity performs the same function for the negative outcome. If you divide the true negatives by all people who did not survive , you get the specificity. Specificity is 0.704142.

ROC curves are a frequently used technique for combining both indicators. As illustrated in the plot below, a ROC curve plots sensitivity on the y axis and false positive rate (1-specificity) on the x axis. What does the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicate? By anticipating a binary outcome, we want to accomplish two objectives concurrently: We want to accurately classify the number of persons with CKD, while also wishing for a low rate of false positives. Thus, we desire a sensitivity of 1 and a false positive rate of 0 for our detector (highlighted in black in the ROC curve below). If, on the other hand, the model is unable to forecast the outcome, the ROC curve will be a diagonal line, as a fair coin toss will have the same predictive power. We properly identify persons 50% of the time and make incorrect predictions 50% of the time.

While sensitivity and specificity are not the sole indicators of performance, it is worth noting that the further the ROC curve is from the diagonal (and closer to the black line), the stronger the model's explanatory power.
