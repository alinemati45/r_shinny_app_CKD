This app illustrates some fundamental concepts in logistic regression. We use Pus Cell, Age, and Blood Pressure to estimate the effect on the Chronic Kidney disease database. 

1- Age

2- Blood Pressure:

Blood Pressure: Low : 80 or less

Blood Pressure: Mid : 80- 120

Blood Pressure: High : 120 or Above

3- Pus Cell: It consists of a buildup of dead, white blood cells that form when the body's immune system responds to the infection

4- Class: CKD =1, NotCKD=0

Class of the Chronic Kidney Disease :

Blood Pressure by the Chronic Kidney Disease:

Chronic Kidney Disease by Age:

Hypertension is both a cause and result of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and affects the great majority of people with the disease. Controlling hypertension is critical in patients with CKD because it results in a slower course of the disease and a decreased risk of CVD. How many people have Chrinic Kidney diease? Who have a higher change to get Chrinic Kidney diease? what about Pus Cell & Age? On the left side you can see simple bar chart to get a first impression.

# Test of Independence

H0: There is no association of one unit increase in blood pressure with chronic kidney disease risk.

H1: There is association of one unit increase in blood pressure with chronic kidney disease risk.

![](./report/demo5.jpg)

![](./report/4.png)
Our Result is :

Because the P-value is clearly less than a = 0.05, we reject H0 and conclude that 
high blood pressure and Chronic Kidney disease are associated in the population.
